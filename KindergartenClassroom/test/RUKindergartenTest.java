/*
* This is a JUnit Test Class, which uses the JUnit package to create
* and run tests (just like in Lab 2)
* 
* You can use this to evaluate your code. Examine these tests, as writing
* similar test cases will help you immensly on other Assignments/Labs, as
* well as moving forward in your CS career.
*
* You WILL NOT SUBMIT THIS CLASS. This is for your own testing purposes only.
* You can STILL use the driver to test, this is optional.
